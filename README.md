# Frontend Fundamentals (HTML 5 & CSS 3)

This repository contains the projects completed during the **Frontend Fundamentals (HTML 5 & CSS 3)** course by Pirple. These projects demonstrate a strong understanding of web development concepts, focusing on HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design.

## What I Learned

### HTML:
Throughout the course, I worked extensively with HTML to structure web pages and create meaningful content. Key concepts I mastered include:
- Understanding the importance of semantic HTML to improve both the readability of the code and the accessibility of web pages.
- Using key HTML elements like `<doctype>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<main>` to structure documents effectively.
- Implementing lists (ordered and unordered) for organizing content, and embedding images and links to enhance the interactivity of web pages.
- Exploring various HTML tags to create well-organized and visually appealing layouts.

### CSS:
In the CSS portion of the course, I learned how to transform plain HTML structures into visually compelling and responsive web pages. My key takeaways from CSS include:
- Styling elements using selectors (types, classes, IDs) and understanding how specificity impacts the application of styles.
- Mastering the box model (including padding, margins, borders) to manage spacing and layout effectively.
- Using advanced CSS techniques like inheritance, type selectors, and direct descendant selectors to control design with precision.
- Implementing mobile-first, responsive web design principles to ensure that websites display beautifully on devices of all sizes.
- Utilizing advanced CSS concepts like media queries to adapt layouts based on screen resolution and device orientation.

## Projects

### Responsive Recipe Website
As part of the course, I developed a responsive recipe website that not only looks visually appealing but also adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. The project involved structuring content with semantic HTML, followed by applying responsive CSS to ensure optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices. The key focus was on clean code and a user-friendly interface.

### YouTube Homepage Clone
For the final project, I took on the challenge of replicating the YouTube homepage using only HTML5 and CSS3. This project allowed me to apply everything I had learned throughout the course, from basic layout structure to more advanced CSS styling techniques. The goal was to accurately recreate the design and layout of the YouTube homepage, focusing on attention to detail, responsive design, and adhering to web standards.
